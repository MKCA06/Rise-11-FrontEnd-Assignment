# React Dashboard Assignment

Welcome to the React Dashboard Assignment repository! This project is a hands-on exercise in recreating a dashboard design using React.js. We are excited to see your implementation and how you bring the given dashboard design to life.

## üöÄ Assignment Tasks:

1. **Create the Given Dashboard Page:**
   Use the attached screenshot of the dashboard design as a reference to build the corresponding page in React.js. Ensure that the layout, components, and styling match the provided design.

2. **Use Any Images and Icons:**
   Feel free to use any images and icons that fit the context of the dashboard. You have the creative freedom to choose assets that enhance the overall look and feel of the page.

3. **Utilize Libraries and Dummy Data:**
   Employ any libraries or dummy data necessary for implementing the graphs and visual elements on the dashboard. This is an opportunity to showcase your skills in integrating third-party tools and handling data in a React application.

   Ensure that your React application is responsive and provides a seamless user experience on mobile screens. The design should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.
